1.[Percolation 渗透问题](https://github.com/genghe123/Algorithms-Fouth-Edition/tree/master/Coursera/Percolation/README.md)
---
**Description:** Given a composite systems comprised of randomly distributed insulating and metallic materials: what fraction
of the materials need to be metallic so that the composite system is an electrical conductor? Given a porous landscape 
with water on the surface (or oil below), under what conditions will the water be able to drain through to the bottom 
(or the oil to gush through to the surface)? Scientists have defined an abstract process known as percolation to model such situations.  

 **问题描述:**将一个不透水的均质方块分割为N*N，最上方为水源，随机打开方块中任意格子，重复此项操作多次，产生一条路径使水能穿过这个方块到达最下方。
